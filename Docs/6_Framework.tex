\section{Theoretical framework}

\subsection{Quantum cryptography and quantum key distribution}

Talk about its origin and minimum requirements to build a quantum key distribution protocol

talk about implementation schemes, based on spin, based on photons.

\subsubsection{Bell Theorem and CHSH}

\subsubsection{E91}

Cite Ekerd 1991 \cite{ekert1991quantum} and futher work (implementation and alternatives like EPR states into the ekert protocol)

\subsection{Production of $\gamma$ bell states}

how to produce entangled states by means of hetero-structure like quantum dots or SPDC

how to convert spin implementation into polarization language and quantum computing implementation

\subsection{Qiskit API}

\subsection{Cirq API}

\subsection{Quantum circuits for protocols}
