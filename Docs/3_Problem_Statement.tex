\section{Problem statement}

Quantum Entanglement is necessary for supporting quantum key distribution, but in the experiment, several physical effects cause decoherence which disables the whole Protocol.
These effects are: the Fine Structure Splitting due to the generation of optical singlet states by radiative cascade (biexciton to exciton exciton to ground) on quantum dots {\huge Cite This}; on the other hand, the selection of the orientation of the analyzer for measuring the states has a well known aftereffect on the anti-correlation probability {\huge cite grynberg, aspect, fabre}.
In this sense it is necesary to study this effects on the robustness of the key generated via E91 protocol with the aim of simulation of quantum algorithms
