Quantum Mechanics is a robust theory that describes the universe on a nano-scale.

Several properties such as: Entanglement and superposition, describe a new behavior of things in quantum mechanics

Classical computation is based: on Shannon's Theorem for using a two state representation and the Turing machine; and has been implemented by using Electricity and optical fiber.

By using a model based on superposition is possible to create a new model of computation based on quantum mechanics called a quantum computation

Feynman was the first person who talked about  Quantum computation in a lecture [look for this] where argued that for better simulation of physics, we need to build computers which behavior be as accurate as  physics predicts
