\section{Objectives}

\subsection{General objective}

To study the influence of the exciton fine structure splitting and measurement orientations on the robustness of cryptographic keys generated via the quantum key distribution protocol E91.

\subsection{Specific objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item To find a relation between the fine structure splitting and the performance of the E91 protocol for quantum key distribution.
    
    \item To evaluate the effect of the measurement angles in the performance of the E91 protocol under the presence of fine structure splitting in the entanglement source.
    
    \item To implement computationally in a quantum simulator, the E91 quantum key distribution protocol under the influence of fine structure splitting to assess the correctness of the theoretical predictions.
\end{itemize}
